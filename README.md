# go-flipbook
go based project that converts video to flipbook printable images - make your own flipbook

##Overview
This project takes input videos and renders frames from the video to images that can be used to make flip books. For example, given this input video: [night sky](test/sky.mp4) in the example we extract frames at 15fps, then composite the frames into a final set of images suitable for printing on a 6x4 piece of photo paper. Examples are:

![](test/output/comp001.jpg)

The frames are rendered so that stacking the final sheets of paper only requires two cuts to assemble all of the frames into one final book. Simply stack all the composite images from first to last, then make two cuts and stack the smaller stacks, you end up with a flip book.

The example was generated by running the following command:
```bash
go install ./cmd/... && fbconvert --clean --verbose --input=./test/sky.mp4 --identifier "night sky" --bgcolor=black --output=./test/output
```

##Options

```bash
Usage of fbconvert:
  -bgcolor string
    	The background color of the image (for border). Can be white|black, defaults to white (default "white")
  -clean
    	If true, all files in the output directory are deleted before generating new items
  -fps int
    	The number of frames to generate per second of video, defaults to 15. Min 15, max 60 (default 15)
  -identifier string
    	A string that will be printed on each frame, for easy identification
  -input string
    	Path to the input video source (required)
  -output string
    	Path where the images will be written to. Images will be generated with names img001.png, img002.png ... etc. (required)
  -skip
    	If true frames are not extracted and the input option is not required, defaults to false
  -verbose
    	Prints verbose output as the process is running
  -version
    	Displays the app version number
 ```
